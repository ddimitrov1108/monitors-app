# Running the Program
=======================

### Windows

1. Open Command Prompt and navigate to the directory where your `.cpp` file is located.
2. Compile and run the program using the following commands:

```bash
g++ -o output.exe input.cpp output.exe
```

Replace `input.cpp` with the name of your `.cpp` file and `output.exe` with the desired name of the executable file.

### Linux/macOS

1. Open Terminal and navigate to the directory where your `.cpp` file is located.
2. Compile and run the program using the following commands:

```bash
g++ -o output input.cpp ./output
```

Replace `input.cpp` with the name of your `.cpp` file and `output` with the desired name of the executable file.

## Note: Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system.
